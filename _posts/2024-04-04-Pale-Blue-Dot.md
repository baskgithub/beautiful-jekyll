这是1990年2月14日旅行者1号于64亿公里外拍摄的一张著名的地球照片，显示了地球像一粒微尘一样悬浮在太阳系的漆黑背景中。卡尔萨根受这张照片启发，写下了《暗淡蓝点》（Pale Blue Dot）一书。

Pale Blue Dot is a photo of Earth that was taken by the Voyager 1 space probe in 1990 from a distance of about 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles) as it was leaving our solar system. This is what Carl Sagan said about the photo:  

Look again at that dot.  
再看一下这个点吧。

That’s here. That’s home. That’s us.  
它在那里。那就是我们的家园，我们的一切。

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.  
你爱的每个人、你认识的每个人、你听说过的每个人，历史上的每一个人，都在它上面度过了自己的一生。

The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there–on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.  
所有我们的欢乐和痛苦，所有言之凿凿的宗教、意识形态和经济思想，所有的猎人和强盗、英雄和懦夫、文明的缔造者和毁灭者、国王和农夫、热恋中的情侣、父亲与母亲、满怀希望的孩子、发明家和探索者、德高望重的教师、腐败的政客、超级明星、最高领袖，人类历史上的所有圣徒和罪人，都聚集在这里——一粒悬浮在阳光中的微尘。

>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”
